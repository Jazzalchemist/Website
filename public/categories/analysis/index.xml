      <description>The focus of this month&amp;rsquo;s #SWDChallenge was on artisanal data.
I found this challenge to be incredibly enjoyable. Why? Because I got to design a visualisation using data that I knew inside and out (since it was about my work history after all!). But hey, that was kinda the point, right?
I want to take a step back here though. I want to address why I used data about my work history.</description>

      <description>This month&amp;rsquo;s #SWDChallenge was to find a visualisation you like and emulate it. I went with the &amp;lsquo;Live Long&amp;rsquo; chart by David McCandless of Information is Beautiful. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of David&amp;rsquo;s work. His visualisations are stunning. I even own two of his books - Information is Beautiful and Knowledge is Beautiful - which I love to flick through when I&amp;rsquo;m struggling for inspiration.
I decided to emulate the &amp;lsquo;Live Long&amp;rsquo; chart because a) I wanted to make an interactive version in Tableau, and b) I saw how I could apply my own style to it.</description>
