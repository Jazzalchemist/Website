I’m a Senior Data Analyst based in Wellington, New Zealand. I have a strong interest in data visualisation and how to effectively communicate through a balance of effective design and thorough analysis.

My blog is a way for me to document tricks and tips about data visualisation, but it is also a way for me to document things I’ve learned along the way. My favourite tools to blog about are Tableau and R, but I will occasionally stray into blogging about Excel, Python and SQL. 

Along with spending my free time learning Tableau and R, I’m also pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree (part-time), majoring in both Computer Science & Statistics. So yeah, I like to keep busy!
